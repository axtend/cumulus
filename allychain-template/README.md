# Substrate Cumulus Allychain Template

A new [Cumulus](https://github.com/axiatech/cumulus/)-based Substrate node, ready for hacking ☁️..

This project is originally a fork of the
[Substrate Node Template](https://github.com/substrate-developer-hub/substrate-node-template)
modified to include dependencies required for registering this node as a **parathread** or
**allychain** to a **relay chain**.

The stand-alone version of this template is hosted on the
[Substrate Devhub Allychain Template](https://github.com/substrate-developer-hub/substrate-allychain-template/)
for each release of Axia. It is generated directly to the upstream
[Allychain Template in Cumulus](https://github.com/axiatech/cumulus/tree/master/allychain-template)
at each release branch using the
[Substrate Template Generator](https://github.com/axiatech/substrate-template-generator/).
